## Output:

The software outputs a folder with :

- Annotated frames;
- Black frames with ROIs shown in white;
- Video frames with annotated ROIs drawn over original content;
- CSV file with annotation data. This file can be used to later edit a video annotation. This CSV has the follow fields:

# Tips 

To decrease the fps or cut the videos you can use [FFMPEG 4.4](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Full release : https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z

* Change the fps:

       ffmpeg -i <input> -filter:v fps=30 <output>

* Cut the video:

       ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -i input.mp4 -to 00:02:00 -c copy output.mp4

* Change the resolution:

       ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=480:320 output_320.mp4
